# Task 1: Python program to perform basic mathematical operations  
It takes two numbers from the user and performs basic math operations: **addition, subtraction, multiplication,** and **division**. Then it shows the results on the screen.
Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. User Input:
   * The program asks the user to enter **two numbers**.
   * `float()` is used so the user can enter decimal numbers (like 5.5 or 10.0), not just whole numbers.
2. Performing Calculations:
    * The program adds, subtracts, and multiplies the two numbers and stores the results in different variables.
3. Handling Division Carefully:
   * Before dividing, it checks if the second number is **not zero**.
   * If itâ€™s not zero, it divides the first number by the second.
   * If it **is zero**, it shows a message instead of dividing, because dividing by zero causes an error.
4. Displaying the Results:
   * It prints all the results in a clean and readable format.
